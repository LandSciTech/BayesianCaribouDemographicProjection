\item{printPlot}{logical. print a plot of the true population trajectory?}

\item{cowCounts}{data.frame. Number of cows counted in aerial surveys each
year. Must have 3 columns "Year", "Count", and "Class" where class is "cow"
in all rows}

\item{freqStartsByYear}{data.frame. Number of collars deployed in each year.
Must have 2 columns "Year" and "numStarts"}

\item{collarNumYears}{integer. Number of years until collar falls off}

\item{collarOffTime}{integer. Month that collars fall off. A number from 1
(January) to 12 (December)}

\item{collarOnTime}{integer. Month that collars are deployed. A number from 1
(January) to 12 (December)}

\item{distScen}{data.frame. Disturbance scenario. Must have columns "Year",
"Anthro", and "fire_excl_anthro" containing the year, \% of the landscape
covered by anthropogenic disturbance buffered by 500 m, and the \% covered
by fire that does not overlap anthropogenic disturbance. See
\code{\link[=disturbanceMetrics]{disturbanceMetrics()}}. If NULL the disturbance scenario is simulated based
on \code{cs}}

\description{
Simulate caribou survival data. First a true population trajectory is
simulated following the national model and a disturbance scenario. Then
realistic observations are simulated from this true population based on a
collaring program with the given parameters.
