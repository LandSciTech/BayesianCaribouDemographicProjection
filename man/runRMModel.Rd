TODO: what is the coding for event enter and exit?}

\item{ageRatio.herd}{either a path to a csv file or a dataframe containing
the columns "Year","Count", and "Class". Where class can be either calf or
cow}

\item{disturbance}{either a path to a csv file or a dataframe containing the
columns "Anthro","fire_excl_anthro","Total_dist","time", and "Year"}

\item{betaPriors}{a list of model priors see \code{\link[=getPriors]{getPriors()}}}

\item{startYear, endYear}{year defining the beginning and end of the survivalt
data to use.}

\item{Nchains}{Number of chains for the Bayesian model}

\item{Niter}{Number of iterations for the Bayesian model}

\item{Nburn}{Length of burn-in for the Bayesian model}

\item{Nthin}{Thinning rate for the Bayesian model}

\item{N0}{Initial population size}

\item{survAnalysisMethod}{Survival analysis method either "KaplanMeier" or
"exp"
TODO: check the above, exp used on line 185 but Exponential on earlier lines
also need to explain what these mean and what the else option is?}

\item{assessmentYrs}{TODO: what is assessmentYrs? defaults to 1 but not sure what it is.}

\item{inpFixed}{an optional list of inputs with names matching the above, if
an argument is included in this list it will override the named argument}

a list with elements:
\itemize{
\item result: an \code{rjags} model object see \code{\link[R2jags:jags]{R2jags::jags()}}.
\item survInput: a data.frame with the input data used in the model.
